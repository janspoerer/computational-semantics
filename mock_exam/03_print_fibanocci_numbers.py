Print out all Fibonacci numbers smaller or equal to a given number
Given a positive number, print out all Fibonacci numbers smaller or equal to that number.
For example, given the number 11 the program should print out: 1 1 2 3 5 8
The next Fibonacci number would be 13 which is already larger than 11.
